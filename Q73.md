## SQL Interview Question 73

#### Problem Statement

<bold>Amazon SQL Interview Question</bold>

You are given a table of tennis players and their matches that they could either win (W) or lose (L).

Find the longest streak of wins. A streak is a set of consecutive won matches of one player. The streak ends once a player loses their next match.
Output the ID of the player or players and the length of the streak.

#### Schema setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE players_results ( match_date DATETIME, match_result VARCHAR(1), player_id INT);

INSERT INTO players_results (match_date, match_result, player_id) VALUES ('2023-01-01', 'W', 1), ('2023-01-02', 'W', 1), ('2023-01-03', 'L', 1), ('2023-01-04', 'W', 1), ('2023-01-01', 'L', 2), ('2023-01-02', 'W', 2), ('2023-01-03', 'W', 2), ('2023-01-04', 'W', 2), ('2023-01-05', 'L', 2), ('2023-01-01', 'W', 3), ('2023-01-02', 'W', 3), ('2023-01-03', 'W', 3), ('2023-01-04', 'W', 3), ('2023-01-05', 'L', 3);
```

#### Expected Output

| player_id | longest_streak |
|-----------|----------------|
| 3         | 4              |

SELECT
