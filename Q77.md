#### Problem Statement

<bold>Amazon SQL Interview Question</bold>

You are working with a table called Orders that tracks customer orders with their order dates and amounts. 
Write a query to find each customerâ€™s latest order amount along with the amount of the second latest order.

#### Schema setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
 order_id INT,
 customer_id INT,
 order_date DATE,
 order_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, order_amount) VALUES
(1, 101, '2024-01-10', 150.00),
(2, 101, '2024-02-15', 200.00),
(3, 101, '2024-03-20', 180.00),
(4, 102, '2024-01-12', 200.00),
(5, 102, '2024-02-25', 250.00),
(6, 102, '2024-03-10', 320.00),
(7, 103, '2024-01-25', 400.00),
(8, 103, '2024-02-15', 420.00);
```

#### Expected Output

| customer_id | latest_order_amount | second_latest_order_amount |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| 101         | 180.00              | 200.00                     |
| 102         | 320.00              | 250.00                     |
| 103         | 420.00              | 400.00                     |
