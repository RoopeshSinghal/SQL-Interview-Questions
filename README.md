# SQL Interview Questions Repository

This repository contains SQL interview questions designed to enhance problem-solving skills and prepare for data analyst interviews. Each question is presented with its solution hidden under a dropdown menuâ€”solve the question first, then check the solution!

## ðŸ“Œ Structure

- New SQL questions are added frequently.
- The questions are sourced from various YouTube channels (I donâ€™t own any of the questions).

> **Solution**: Expand the dropdown below each question to view the solution after attempting it yourself.

Happy coding, and best of luck cracking your SQL interviews!
