# SQL Interview Questions Repository

This repository contains SQL interview questions designed to enhance problem-solving skills and prepare for data analyst interviews. Each question is presented with its solution hidden under a dropdown menuâ€”solve the question first, then check the solution!

## ðŸ“Œ Structure

- New SQL questions are added regularly.
- The questions are sourced from various YouTube channels (I donâ€™t own any of the questions).
